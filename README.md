## 🌱 About My Growth
Currently enrolled in a Bachelor's program focused on Internet of Things Engineering, with an expected graduation in 2025, I'm actively absorbing knowledge and gaining hands-on experience. My academic path at赣南医科大学, combined with practical projects, has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming.

## 🛠️ Skill Set in Progress
- **Java Enthusiast**: I'm passionate about Java and constantly learning its depths, from basics like collections and multithreading to more advanced topics like Lambda expressions and Stream API.
- **Spring Framework Student**: I'm diving into the world of Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and MyBatis, trying to grasp the magic of IoC and AOP.
- **Cloud-Native Curiosity**: I've started exploring Spring Cloud and the Alibaba microservices ecosystem, fascinated by how they enable scalability and resilience.
- **Data Handling & Caching**: MySQL and Redis are tools I'm familiar with, and I'm always looking to improve my understanding of efficient data management.
- **DevOps Adventurer**: Linux, Docker, Nginx, and my initial encounters with Jenkins have me excited about efficient deployments and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Frontend Dabbler**: React18, TypeScript, and Ant Design Pro are technologies I'm starting to work with, aiming to create user-friendly interfaces.
- **Python and Flask Sidekick**: I've dipped my toes into Python for backend tasks and Flask for creating APIs, broadening my tech arsenal.

## 📚 Learning Through Projects
- **AI-BI Analytics Platform**: My contribution to a Spring Boot-based data analytics platform taught me about integrating AI, streamlining data analysis, and enhancing user experiences.
- **OCR Online Recognition Platform**: This open-source project marked my first steps into a cross-language (Java & Python) solution, pushing me to apply DDD principles and microservices architecture.

## 👥 Collaborative Spirit
- I'm open to any opportunities to collaborate on projects that challenge me and allow me to grow, especially those involving AI, data processing, or full-stack development.
- I believe in the power of teamwork and am eager to learn from others.
